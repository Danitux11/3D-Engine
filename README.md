# 3D-Engine
A simple 3D Engine made in Python, allowing users to create and control objects in the three-dimensional space.

Commands: 
1. Press "n" to create a new body, "p" to delete the last created body, and "r" to reset the position and angle of the camera
2. Press the movement keys, along with "w" and "s" to move the camera. Mouse movements (or the keys "z", "x", "c", "v", alternatively) will change the angle of the camera. The keys "b" and "m" also allow the user to change the roll of the camera.
